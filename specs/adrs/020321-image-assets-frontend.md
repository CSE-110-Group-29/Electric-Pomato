## Status: accepted

## Deciders: Teresa

## Context and Problem Statement

What image assets should we use for our final project?

## Things Teresa considered and the decisions for each question
1. What parts of the project should be implemented using image assets and by building?
    - Teresa decided that only four asssets of her design are needed: red tomato, green tomato, bolt, and plug. The development team will build everything else for the project.
    - Two of these four assets should have a glowing version as well, specifically the green tomato and bolt images. This is to indicate if the user is hovering over the bolt button on the landing page and the green tomato when it's waiting for the user to start the timer.
2. How should the start day graphic be implemented?
    - There were two options for this: timer with a "start" button below it and a green tomato with a "start" overlay. Teresa decided to choose the latter.
3. What should the file types/extensions be for these assets?
    - Both PNG files and SVG files were tested. Currently, the development team is sticking with PNG for the bolt image and SVG for the red tomato, green tomato, and bolt.
