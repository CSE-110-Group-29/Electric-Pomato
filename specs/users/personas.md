# User Personas

## Persona 1: Undergraduate Student

- **Biography:** Kristjan Sethunya is an undergraduate senior studying Electrical Engineering. She is in the process of exploring the various paths she can take after graduation. Currently, she is an assisting PhD student conducting research on creating security protocols for drone authentication. She hopes to get her name on more research papers, so she can be a fighting candidate for a Master’s or a PhD degree in the near future. Her personal interests lie in drones and Indian classical music.
- **Behaviors & Goals:** She is very hardworking and detail-oriented. She often goes on late night Taco Bell and coffee runs as she stays up to finish all her work. She tries to participate in every activity she gets to know about (both social and academic) so that she can broaden her experiences. The three goals she wants in her near future are to experience European Study Abroad programs, work for a startup to learn a wide variety of technical skills, and get more papers published so her grad school application is stronger.
- **Pain-points:** As indicated above, Kristjan Sethunya is an itinerant individual. She's often moving around, although at the same time, she still wants to check things on her laptop. Thus, she's grown fond of portable applications. Additionally, there are some days when she doesn't want to carry relatively heavy items like her laptops around. She wishes that one day she will be able to manage her coursework and research papers on mobile devices, although at the moment, she's dissapointed with the tools available on her devices.

## Persona 2: Employee of the National Science Foundation

- **Biography:** Sango Cali is a recent graduate who is now employed at the National Science Foundation. Her goal is to provide value for the foundation by discovering potential groundbreaking studies, which she intends to achieve by keeping maintaining connections and overseeing research efforts around the world. As suggested by her current employment, she has also completed several research programs during her undergraduate studies, specifically in the field of oceanography.
- **Behaviors & Goals:** Despite the tedious work, she is still patient in conducting research studies. Additionally, she’s also passionate about the environment and understands the frustrations and difficulties of those who are also involved in research. Other than oceanography research, she also hikes and swims in her free time. While monitoring different studies, she hopes to identify high-potential areas in research, communicate with other researchers, and attend seminars to note observations that she can report back to NSF.
- **Pain-points:** Sango Cali is not exactly a patient person. While she does remain professional in her workplace, she can't help but be a little irritated when having to wait for extended periods of time. Additionally, given the fast-paced environment she works in, she tends to use well-optimized applications to manage her projects. In combination with her lack of patience, she will also get annoyed if she ends up working with tools that have slow response times.

## Persona 3: Parent/Caretaker

- **Biography:** Janine Abrar is a working mother with 2 toddlers. She works a 9-5 job as an accountant. She drops off her children at school, and picks them up after work from an afterschool program. She also prepares meals for her household at home. She runs a tight schedule, and needs help organizing her daily activities.
- **Behaviors & Goals:** She runs a tight schedule, and needs help organizing her daily activities. She wakes up at 5 am every morning to prepare coffee, breakfast, and pack lunch for her toddlers. She is always in a rush and forgetting things. Her motto is “One step at a time.” Her goal is to build a structured routine. She wants to keep her professional and personal life organized.
- **Pain-points:** Common painpoints she runs into as a mother is not having enough time to prepare lunch for her toddlers. She often has to buy Lunchables or give them lunch money as a result. She feels as though she does not have enough time to exercise in the morning and forgets the tasks she has to do for the rest of the day. She often has to dismiss some of the tasks she had planned to do and delay it towards the next day or the end of the week. Thus, given the work overload, she wants to find ways to manage her tasks in a much more organized manner or find an assistant to help her reduce this overload.

## Persona 4: Data Scientist
- **Biography:** Sunil Shivali is an avid data scientist who works for the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Compared to her co-workers, he knows a relatively large number of programming languages but prefers to use Python and R. As an extrovert, he's communivative and forthcoming, tending to serve as one of the best leaders of his group.
- **Behaviors & Goals:** Although data science is his passion, he would love to gain some insight into the field of machine learning as both machine learning and data science can be closely related. Aside from that, few people know that he's interested in sports (particularly basketball), especially when it comes to the statistics of players and seasonal games. During his free time, he would use continue using his skills in data science to analyze trends and patterns based on these statistics.
- **Pain-points:** Given that Sunil Shivali is used to a setting of automation using libraries, he gets rather frustrated when he has to manually track information. To him, typing things out on a word document or excel sheet is rather cumbersome, tedious, and mundane, so he sometimes tries to alleviate these issues by writing his own programs. This is even worse when he doesn't have access to some form of visualization. It's usually difficult for him to understand data if raw data is the only thing he can work with.

## Persona 5: Software Developer Intern
- **Biography:** Philip Ulla is a software developer intern at XYZ Solutions who specializes in C and C++, although he is familiar with a bit of Java. He's regarded as one of the faster learners in the company, sometimes achieving a level of performance of that of trained full-time employees. Even though this is his first internship, his manager has allowed him to participate in a project for writing 3D visualizatin tools to better assist his co-workers, which typically is only meant for more experienced teams in XYZ Solutions. Lastly, he's introduced changes to his team's Github repository to facilitate better workflow.
- **Behaviors & Goals:** Philip Ulla generally takes infrequent but long breaks, walking laps around his neighborhood or around the exterior and interior of his workplace, which greatly helps him clear his mind before returning to writing code. On the weekend, he likes to go shopping with his friends and take them out to eat at restaraunts, especially Benihana. Sometimes, he spices things up by telling the chef to "fabricate" a fake birthday for his ones of his friends to bemuse them. His most important goal is a simple one: become proficient with Java.
- **Pain-points:** Although Philip Ulla has had a lot of success at his internship and is passionate about programming for XYZ Solutions, he tends to feel rather uncomfortable with the work environment. His unique level of success as an intern causes some people to envy him, although fortunately not to the point of serious issues. Additionally, this is the first time he's been exposed to poorly documented applications - both in code and on the front-end of the application itself - which has caused him a great amount of frustration when trying to understand the 3D visualization project he's given.

## Persona 6: Librarian
- **Biography:** Samuel Ruperto is a librarian who lives and works at a newly opened area in Chicago. As an enthusiastic reader, he welcomes people to come to him to discuss some of the stories they've read. In addition to reading, he also writes some of his own books, ranging from science fiction to literature. He also sometimes coordinates "book day" events in which he displays some of the most popular books in his library. Lastly, because the library quickly becomes disorganized, he often tries to look for student volunteers to help out.
- **Behaviors & Goals:** Samuel Ruperto is introverted, but that isn't to say that he enjoys company at his library. Typically, after a long day at the library, he would need to spend some time alone in his room soon after he and his wife make dinner together. One of the things he would like to do is to travel more, explore more areas, and learn more about different cultures and writing styles.
- **Pain-points:** Unfortunately, Samuel Ruperto lives and works at a place that's currently under construction - the sound pollution often breaks his focus and makes exasperates him. Over time, this starts to get to him, and he tries to find ways to minimize as much sound coming into his life as possible, whether it's using ear plugs, muting all his notifications on his phone, etc.

## Persona 7: Professor/CEO
- **Biography:** Thomas A. Powell is a professor who teaches Software Engineering at UCSD and is the CEO of Pint and ZingSoft. Passionate about web development and workflow practices, he wants to share his experiences with many students, preparing them to face the flux of industry and the large amount of uncertainty that comes with it. Taking this further, he's written several books that deleniate the intricacies of web development - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; you name it.
- **Behaviors & Goals:** Bring a professor and CEO of two companies doesn't mean he can't have fun. He loves retro gaming and has a strong urge to incorporate memes into parts of his career, especially in the slides he shows during Software Engineering lectures. He also is a fan of soccer, even using it as examples to show fortitude when it comes to learning web development and workflow practices. Most importantly, he's an advocate of the Pomodoro Technique and exhorts others to implement it into their daily lives.
- **Pain-points:** Overseeing many projects, he's used to seeing bad practices in software development such as poor documentation, inhospitable environments, and unorganized workflow. He's also isn't fond of the types of Pomodoro applications he's seen so far - most of them contain unecessary features that violate some of the philosophies of the Pomodoro Technique, especially those that pertain to the timer itself such as allowing the user to pause their timer. Lastly, he dissaproves of memes that aren't dank enough for his standards.
