## Week 8

Finish first Sprint and start the next. Primary goal is to add final touches of functionality for the user between the Timer and TaskList.

- Assigned more issues once again

    - Plan:
      - Discuss how to make tasks, organize them, and make estimate Pomos for each task
      - Explain what a Pomo is.
    - Track:
      - Discuss how the app displays the current task to the user during the timer/break sequences.
    - Record:
      - Discuss comparison of Expected to Actual number of Pomodoros?
  - Set up the main branch to use ES6 import/export modules instead of the CommonJS ones
  - Remove duplicate Github workflow called JSDoc CI
- Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective
- Create second sprint project backlog
- Resolved the following issues:
  - Changes after switching to ES6
    - Main has decided on ES6 or CommonJS import/exports
    - session_script conforms with main
    - Timer and TaskList classes conform with main
    - Jest tests created conform with main

## Week 9

Continue working on issues and branches. Goal is to have an MVP by end of week.

- Assigned more issues
  - Update JSDocs format
    - Update the Globals tags to have functions that are supposed to be under a class elsewhere.
    - @function is likely use to store the name of the function, not its description.
  - Continue finding and debugging issues that arrizes
    - CSS issues
    - User input issues
    - functionality issues
  - Get the Timer object to work with session_script
  - Deal with edge cases related to HTML
    - Use `<noscript>` tag to tell the user to enable JavaScript 
  - Implement .app-title with the proper header
    - Cases to handle:
      - "Arman's Day"
        - Will display while the day hasn't started, there should be flag for "started", essentially is only display while editing the task list.
      - "Current Task"
        - Will display during a Pomo "Timer" in localStorage == 1 or when a break is ongoing and we are in 1/3 Pomos of a task.
      - "Next Task"
        - Will display during a break, and we are at 3/3 Pomos.
      - "Final Task"
        - Will display during a break, and we are about to enter the last task in the TaskList.
- From ths point on, the team only has to deal with minor issues for the MVP
  - Handle cases that should be dealt with on window.onload()
  - Add a loader for app.html
    - Redirects to this page look strange because we don't have a default loader for app.html
  - Update TaskList after each actual Pomodoro
  - Handle the final task case
  - Implement Sim's suggestion: allow the user on app.html to return to index.html
  - Choose a CSS style for the button toggle
    - Update: we no longer have a toggle-able button, so this issue isn't ever truly resolved
  - Update SVG images to not have square hitboxes
  - TaskList visual bug: TaskList fails to pull up properly when resizing window
  - Add a notification component
  - Change UsernameInput component to only prompt once
  - Handle long TaskList overflow
  - TaskList doesn't check for valid inputs (> 1 estimated Pomodoros)
    - Issue itself was never truly "resolved" because the input box for estimated number of Pomodoros has been replaced with a "rating" system, which is guaranteed to have proper inputs
    - Future issues related to this have been denied
    - See week 10's issues about the "slider" object
  - Update landing page documentation again
    - No changes were actually made when this issue was resolved
- More unit tests to add code coverage
- Add more code for HTMLElements to help communication between JavaScript and HTML
- Resolved the following issues:
  - Interaction between the Timer and TaskList objects

  - Wrapped TaskListUI and AddRowUI to a parent class
  - Finalized system diagram
  - Finished documentation on Landing Page
