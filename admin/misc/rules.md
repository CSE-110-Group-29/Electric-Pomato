## 2) Primary Means of Communication and  Expectations

Primary form of communication: Slack

- Keep slack notifications on or check up on the channel at least once a day.
- Respond with an emoji on important posts within 24 hours of posting.
- Respond with reply to @/@everyone or direct messages within 24 hours of posting.

Discussing project issues:

- Post project related issues on GitHub Issues within the repo.
- Discussions about existing issues take place on the #github-issues channel in Slack.

## 3) Schedule Meetings

Weekly Meetings: Fridays, 4:00pm to approximately 5:00pm. We will also have casual meet-ups at various times to get to know each other better.

## 4) General Responsibilities/Values for ALL Team Members

- Respond to communications promptly, Slack or Github. Acknowledge communications with reactions (comments, emojis, etc.) for important posts.
- Be honest and transparent about your tasks current/upcoming events.
- Respect each other’s time. If it’s an emergency, Slack’s force notification or text messages can be used. Otherwise, try to get back to people within 24 hours.
- At the beginning of each weekly meeting, everyone is expected to share an update/status report on progress, issues, accomplishments, etc. Updates are to keep everyone on the same page.
- If you’re stuck, ask for help! Someone might know the answer and speed the troubleshooting up. We are still learning and no-one is expected to be a pro, the better we can communicate road blocks the easier we can overcome them.
- Put in a fair amount of effort. To succeed we’ll all have to do our part.(there’s probably a better way to phrase this but i basically just mean try your best, everyone should strive to complete things on time and to the best of their ability, and if they’re unable to, communicate that so we can accommodate. all team assignments are everyone’s responsibility)
  - I (Allen) was going to say roughly the same thing. Please don’t procrastinate. If you’re unable to complete the task they are assigned due to external factors, then that’s fine (as long as that person communicates with the rest of the group), but if you are able to dedicate time to working on a task, then try not to put it off for too long.

## 5) Conflict Resolution

- Group conflict resolution: majority vote (5/9 required) to reach consensus on decisions regarding components of the project.
- Personal conflict resolution:
  1. Direct private communication through Slack
  2. Zoom Meeting (Minimum: 15 minutes)
  3. Zoom Meeting with Sim
  4. Zoom Meeting with Professor Powell

## 6) Expectations of Faculty and GTA’s

If a major conflict issue arises, reach out to Sim.
