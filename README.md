### Set Up Local Linter:
- Make sure `node` is installed
- `cd` to root directory of local repository
- `npm install` in console to install dependencies locally
- Download ESLint VSCode extension

And that should be it!
> Note: `npm install` will install all dependencies into a directory called `node_modules/` which will not be tracked by git so it has been added to the `.gitignore`, we won't be including this directory in the remote repo.
