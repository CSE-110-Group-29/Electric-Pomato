## Week 5

Design Pitch & Begin Working on Project Backlog

- Assigned issues, and began coding in seperate branches.
  - Create a basic working timer object and library
    - Figure out how to keep a running counter in Javascript
    - Figure out how to set parameters for the counter (count-down from 25 minutes, etc.)
    - Figure out how to trigger simple events connected to timer running out (pomo is complete, add 1 to log)
  - Create a basic working TaskList object and library
    - Ability to read in a pre-existing list from local memory
    - Trigger event that displays text entry boxes after "Add element" is pressed

    - Ability to add new element and properly render list with new element
    - Ability to delete element and properly render list with element removed
    - Make sure it holds data as a JSON
  - Add checks for value inputs when creating a new task or editing a task.
    - Name is non empty
    - Estimated Pomos is an integer
    - Estimated Pomos > 0
  - Add interaction between the Timer and TaskList objects
    - Ability for task-list to receive "done" flag from timer
    - Ability for "done" flag to increment the correct element in task-list (we can have boolean "chosen-task" variable)
    - Ability for task-list to mark a task as "completed"
  - CSS mockups
    - Have working paper css mockup as a baseline
    - Flesh out Teresa's idea in css (graphics, design language, format, etc.)

## Week 6

Begin the first sprint. Primary goal is to have a functional timer and tasklist on GitHub Pages.

  - Add image assets for the front-end of the project
    - Green Tomato
      - Green Tomato Highlighted.
    - "Start Day" graphic
    - Red Pomato.
  - Implement Unit Tests using Jest
    - Add Jest to list of dependencies in package.json (so that npm install will automatically include Jest)
    - Create a new GitHub Workflow that runs unit tests triggered on all pushes (see link)
    - Verify that unit tests are properly running on new pushes and catching errors
  - Implement JSDoc workflow 
  - Add unit tests for Timer object
    - Class should have a few unit tests initializing the object and accessing its elements
    - At least two base-case/simple unit tests for each function
    - At least three edge-case/less-simple unit tests for each function (this is where we try to break it ðŸ˜ˆ)
  - Convert the System Diagram.jpg file into a Draw.io file
- Created core CI/CD Pipeline
- Continued working on seperate branches.
- Resolved the following issues:
  - Implemented Jest for unit test
  - Finished adding unit test for Timer object, but more are added in the future
  - Converted the System Diagram.jpg file into a Draw.io file

## Week 7

Continue working on first sprint.

- Assigned even more issues to work on
  - Figure out how to implement and use the handshake between the TaskList and the front-end HTML cleaner in the TimerUI.js file
  - Create a parent component for TaskListUI and AddRowUI
    - TaskListUI and AddRowUI are seperate components, so they need to be wrapped together
  - Update the system diagram
  - Start creating ADRs to before we build up huge technical debt
    - Front-end ADRs
      - High Fidelity Design
      - Image Assets
      - Cascading Style Sheets

- Resolved the following issues:
  - Basic working timer object and library
  - CSS mockups
  - Add image assets to front-end

## Week 8
