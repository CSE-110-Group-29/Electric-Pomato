# Foundations (The Context)

Two interrelated aspects of time:
1. **Becoming.** An abstract dimensional apect of time that gives rise to the habit of measuring time (seconds, minutes, hours); the idea of representing time on an axis, as we would spatial dimensions; the concept of the duration of an event (the distance between two points on the temporal axis); the idea of being late (again the distance between two points on the temporal axis).

> see Henry Bergson, *Creative Evolution*

2. **The Succession of Events.** A concrete aspect of temporal order: We wake up, we shower, we have breakfast, we study, we have lunch, we have a nap, we play, we eat, and we go to bed. Children come to have this notion of time before they develop the idea of abstract time that passes regardless of the events that take place.

## Goals of the Pomodoro Technique
The aim of the Pomodoro Technique is to provide a simple tool/process for improving productivity (your own and that of your team). It can do the following:

- Alleviate anxiety linked to *becoming*
- Enhance focus and concentration by cutting down on interruptions
- Increase awareness of one's decisions
- Boost motivation and keep it constant
- Bolster the determination to achieve one's goals
- Refine the estimation process in both qualitative and quantitative terms
- Improve one's work or study process
- Strengthen one's determination to keep applying oneself in complex situations

## Basic Assumptions
The Pomodoro Technique is founded on three key elements:

- **A different way of seeing time** that no longer is focused on the concept of *becoming*. This alleviates anxiety and thus leads to enhanced personal effectiveness.
- **Better use of the mind.** This enables us to achieve greater clarity of thought, higher consciousness, and sharper focus while facilitating learning.
- **The employment of easy-to-use, unobtrusive tools.** This reduces the complexity of applying the technique while favoring continuity and allows us to concentrate our efforts on the goals we want to accomplish. Many time-management techniques fail because they add another level of complexity to the intrinsic complexity of the task at hand.

## Primary Inspirations for Pomodoro Technique
- Time-boxing (Tony Buzan, *The Brain User's Guide*)
- Dynamics of play (Hans-Georg Gadamer, *Truth and Method*)
