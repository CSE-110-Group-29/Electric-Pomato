4) Introduce how to [Create Issues on Github](https://github.com/DonaldWolfson/cse110-w21-group29/wiki/How-to-Post-an-Issue) in a unified way.
5) Introduce how to [Work on Issues](https://github.com/DonaldWolfson/cse110-w21-group29/wiki/How-to-Work-on-an-Issue) in a unified way.
6) Introduce DevOps and Testing.
7) Begin to split features into digestible features.
   1) We'll likely post Github issues after the meeting to save on time. Maybe do one as an example.

   1) If we don't get to this, agree on what app, and where we intend to do this for this weekend.
9) Open Discussion

## Meetings Notes

1. Presented Design Team's Mini Pitch. Most of the selected ideas aren't in these meeting notes. They're in the [rough](https://github.com/DonaldWolfson/cse110-w21-group29/tree/main/specs/interface/rough) directory. Below are some new things that were brought up.
   1. People really liked the Tomato theme (add those as symbols later).
   2. Found a cool [CSS library](https://www.getpapercss.com/) to possibly use.
      - Development team will test this out in the future.
      - Update: half of the members favor Teresa's artwork, but a consensus hasn't been reached on what type of style we should use yet.
   4. Simplify the break button to (Done with Task) and (Done with Session).
      1. If Done with Task button clicked the next task will be booted up at the end of break.
         1. Else, the same task is repeated.
      2. Replace "Day" with "Session" incase of multiple "Session"'s in a day.  
   5. Debate if we want new user, returning user.
      1. Helpful Links:
         1. [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
         2. [Resource](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/cookies-vs-local-storage-2f3732c7d977)
         3. [Single Page Vs. Multipage](https://medium.com/@NeotericEU/single-page-application-vs-multiple-page-application-2591588efe58)
      2. Decided on multipage app.
2. Decided not to explain how to create and work on issues in this meeting but to let people message Donald instead. He's already created two Wiki pages for them.
3. Didn't get to DevOps and Testing today because the mini pitch took way longer than expected, but Arman and Liam will be handling this outside the meeting.
4. Began moving to [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lWyGFBY=/).
    1. Allen briefly showed an example of a work flow.
    2. Managed to finalize Work Flow in the meeting.

## Tasks to Complete

1. Read over the two GitHub Wikis.
2. Add relevannt issues (break them up!).
   1. There is difference between front end of the feature, the back end, and it communicating with the page (could be 2-3 issues).
3. Do some research on the parts you're working on.
4. If possible meetings this weekend to attend to work together.
