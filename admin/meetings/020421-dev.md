- Start/finish time: 4:00 PM PST - 6:00 PM PST

## Meeting Goals

1. Look at code structure options, "html in js"/"js in html"/separate object instance etc.
2. Go over a code style guide, preferably get everyone a linter or restyle with CI/CD.
3. Get everyone on board with the current prototype and familiar with the different kind of challenges we will run into.
4. Figure out specific UI/UX features and how difficult they would be to implement. If something is hard but wanted, we can work on an easier version first and then work towards the end goal.
5. Go over the limitations of paper.css for mobile friendliness and extensibility/custom styling.
6. An issue with the current approach is although it is pretty reliable, I am re rendering the entire tbody and re adding every event listener each time which isn't the best in terms of performance.
7. If we go with a custom css approach, we can easily track edit/non edit mode with input's `disabled` property.
