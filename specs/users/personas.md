# User Personas

## Persona 1: Undergraduate Student

- **Biography:** Student 1 is an undergraduate senior studying Electrical Engineering. She is in the process of exploring the various paths she can take after graduation. Currently, she is an assisting PhD student conducting research on creating security protocols for drone authentication. She hopes to get her name on more research papers, so she can be a fighting candidate for a Master’s or a PhD degree in the near future. Her personal interests lie in drones and Indian classical music.
- **Behaviors & Goals:** She is very hardworking and detail-oriented. She often goes on late night Taco Bell and coffee runs as she stays up to finish all her work. She tries to participate in every activity she gets to know about (both social and academic) so that she can broaden her experiences. The three goals she wants in her near future are to experience European Study Abroad programs, work for a startup to learn a wide variety of technical skills, and get more papers published so her grad school application is stronger.
- **Pain-points:** Despite her excellent performance in research, she often struggles to match her performance in classes with that of research. She tends to put off work in classes. She isn’t fond of relying on coffee runs in Taco Bell to complete her work, especially if it’s for school work.

## Persona 2: Employee of the National Science Foundation

- **Biography:** Person 2 is a recent graduate who is now employed at the National Science Foundation. Her goal is to provide value for the foundation by discovering potential groundbreaking studies, which she intends to achieve by keeping maintaining connections and overseeing research efforts around the world. As suggested by her current employment, she has also completed several research programs during her undergraduate studies, specifically in the field of oceanography.
- **Behaviors & Goals:** Despite the tedious work, she is still patient in conducting research studies. Additionally, she’s also passionate about the environment and understands the frustrations and difficulties of those who are also involved in research. Other than oceanography research, she also hikes and swims in her free time. While monitoring different studies, she hopes to identify high-potential areas in research, communicate with other researchers, and attend seminars to note observations that she can report back to NSF.
- **Pain-points:** Although patient, she tends to have difficulty keeping with research efforts due to relatively inefficient work ethic. While oceanography is her field of study, she tends to get distracted by other topics in environmentalism and often would spend a few hours reading about them.
