# March 3rd 2021, Landing Page and HTML ADR

## Status: accepted

## Deciders: Teresa

## Context and Problem Statement

What features do we add to the landing page?

## Things to consider

1. Should we permit the user to return to the landing page?

## Decision outcome

1. This was suggested by Sim. We decided to implement it because relatively quick to add and because it's a nice quality of life feature.
