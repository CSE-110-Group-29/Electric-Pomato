# User Personas

## Persona 1: Undergraduate Student

- **Biography:** Student 1 is an undergraduate senior studying Electrical Engineering. She is in the process of exploring the various paths she can take after graduation. Currently, she is an assisting PhD student conducting research on creating security protocols for drone authentication. She hopes to get her name on more research papers, so she can be a fighting candidate for a Master’s or a PhD degree in the near future. Her personal interests lie in drones and Indian classical music.
- **Behaviors & Goals:** She is very hardworking and detail-oriented. She often goes on late night Taco Bell and coffee runs as she stays up to finish all her work. She tries to participate in every activity she gets to know about (both social and academic) so that she can broaden her experiences. The three goals she wants in her near future are to experience European Study Abroad programs, work for a startup to learn a wide variety of technical skills, and get more papers published so her grad school application is stronger.
- **Pain-points:** As indicated above, student 1 is an itinerant individual. She's often moving around, although at the same time, she still wants to check things on her laptop. Thus, she's grown fond of portable applications. Additionally, there are some days when she doesn't want to carry relatively heavy items like her laptops around. She wishes that one day she will be able to manage her coursework and research papers on mobile devices, although at the moment, she's dissapointed with the tools available on her devices.

## Persona 2: Employee of the National Science Foundation

- **Biography:** Person 2 is a recent graduate who is now employed at the National Science Foundation. Her goal is to provide value for the foundation by discovering potential groundbreaking studies, which she intends to achieve by keeping maintaining connections and overseeing research efforts around the world. As suggested by her current employment, she has also completed several research programs during her undergraduate studies, specifically in the field of oceanography.
- **Behaviors & Goals:** Despite the tedious work, she is still patient in conducting research studies. Additionally, she’s also passionate about the environment and understands the frustrations and difficulties of those who are also involved in research. Other than oceanography research, she also hikes and swims in her free time. While monitoring different studies, she hopes to identify high-potential areas in research, communicate with other researchers, and attend seminars to note observations that she can report back to NSF.
- **Pain-points:** Person 2 is not exactly a patient person. While she does remain professional in her workplace, she can't help but be a little irritated when having to wait for extended periods of time. Additionally, given the fast-paced environment she works in, she tends to use well-optimized applications to manage her projects. In combination with her lack of patience, she will also get annoyed if she ends up working with tools that have slow response times.

## Persona 3: Parent/Caretaker

- **Biography:** Person 3 is a working mother with 2 toddlers. She works a 9-5 job as an accountant. She drops off her children at school, and picks them up after work from an afterschool program. She also prepares meals for her household at home. She runs a tight schedule, and needs help organizing her daily activities.
- **Behaviors & Goals:** She runs a tight schedule, and needs help organizing her daily activities. She wakes up at 5 am every morning to prepare coffee, breakfast, and pack lunch for her toddlers. She is always in a rush and forgetting things. Her motto is “One step at a time.” Her goal is to build a structured routine. She wants to keep her professional and personal life organized.
- **Pain-points:** Common painpoints she runs into as a mother is not having enough time to prepare lunch for her toddlers. She often has to buy Lunchables or give them lunch money as a result. She feels as though she does not have enough time to exercise in the morning and forgets the tasks she has to do for the rest of the day. She often has to dismiss some of the tasks she had planned to do and delay it towards the next day or the end of the week. Given the work overload, she hopes to find ways to manage her tasks in a much more organized manner or find an assistant to help her reduce this overload.
