## Status: accepted

## Deciders: Teresa, Liam, Donald, Andy

## Context and Problem Statement

[What are the features and mechanics that we want to include in our final design of our application?]

## Considered Options

- Use CSS themes, specifically the paper CSS theme
- Design only using a simplistic layout with minimal art
- Draw our own designs
- 25-30 minute break timer after 4 Pomodoros
- To-do today/Task list sheet
- Activity Inventory sheet
- Unplanned and urgent list
- Urgent task slot
- Records sheet
- Estimate Pomodoros
- Allow and track multiple estimations for a single task
- Indicate estimated and real Pomodoros below timer
- Plots and visuals
- Begin button for timer
- Display task remaining and completed count
- Landing page
- Docmentation on separate wiki page
- Documentation on application itself
- Store user accounts
- Only keep track of a single user
- Single page for timer
- Multiple pages for timer
- Pop-up task list
- Display task list and timer on the same page
- Exit application button during break timer
- Hide timer and replace it with a hoverable "bar"
- I finished early! button
- I need more time! button
- Prompt the user to input more tasks if they completed all their tasks

## Decision Outcome

### Accepted

- Draw our own designs
  - Below, we were considering CSS themes, especially the paper theme, but Teresa showed us some drawings, which looked considerably better and much more fitting for the setting of a Pomodoro Timer
- 25-30 minute break timer after 4 Pomodoros
  - This is a core functionality of the timer, so we need to include it

### Rejected

- Design only using a simplistic layout with minimal art
  - Most of the members felt that having minimal art was a bit too bland and uninteresting for our application
- Use CSS themes, specifically the paper CSS theme
  - The team was considering this first, but as mentioned above, we saw Teresa's drawings for the application and found it much more fitting for the project
- To-do today/Task list sheet
- Activity Inventory sheet
- Unplanned and urgent list
- Urgent task slot
- Records sheet
- Estimate Pomodoros
- Allow and track multiple estimations for a single task
- Indicate estimated and real Pomodoros below timer
- Plots and visuals
- Begin button for timer
- Display task remaining and completed count
- Landing page
- Docmentation on separate wiki page
- Documentation on application itself
- Store user accounts
- Only keep track of a single user
- Single page for timer
- Multiple pages for timer
- Pop-up task list
- Display task list and timer on the same page
- Exit application button during break timer
- Hide timer and replace it with a hoverable "bar"
- I finished early! button
- I need more time! button
