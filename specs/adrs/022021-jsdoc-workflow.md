- Ask Arman about this.

## Status: accepted

## Deciders: Class Recommendation, Arman, and Liam

## Context and Problem Statement

How should we set up documentation in our workflow?

## Things to consider

1. How do we want to create documentation for this project?
2. The different types of documentation frameworks that exist.

## Decision Outcome

1. The DevOps team chose to implement automatic documentation mainly because it's a requirement for the class.
2. They chose chose JSDocs as the documentation framework for the project.
    - JSDocs seems to be mainstream used framework.
    - It was suggested by the professor in lecture.
    - JSDocs is already a framework that has been adopted by several members in our group. There are a few others like ESDoc and Gitbook, but the team didn't look into them much because they figured that learning something new isn't efficient.
