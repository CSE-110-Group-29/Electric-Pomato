  - Lack of Collaboration
    - A lot of our issues/feature requests were small changes so it made sense that we weren't synchronously working.
    - We didn't take advantage of pair programming until really late into the quarter.
    - Some of use would fall behind on the code, so they couldn't keep up with each other's tasks.
    - Lack of communication meant that some code would be resolved by people who already were assigned to issues.
      - We could have taken advantage of the github issues more.

  - Progress
    - We all got a long really well.
    - Some people are very happy with how little conflict we had.
      - One of the first times some of our group members had a good group project experience.
    - People who weren't good at certain things found other tasks to work on.

  - Technical
    - People are worried about the final touches.
      - We'll get to what we can, and that's ok.

  - Team Dynamic
    - Great communication.
    - Team clicked well.
    - Super efficient.
    - This was the least stressfull class for a lot of us because of our dynamic.
