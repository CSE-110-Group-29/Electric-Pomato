# Feb. 26th 2021, HTML ADR

## Status: accepted

## Deciders: Annika, Andy, and Donald

## Context and Problem Statement

This ADR is meant to keep track of setting up our HTML code in our codebase?

## Things to consider

- Do we keep all of our HTML code in one file or split it?

## Decision outcome
1. Do we keep all of our HTML code in one file or split it?
    - HTML files should now be split into three different files: index.html, done.html, and app.html. These will represent the different page layouts (landing page, timer page, and records sheet page), which makes it more organized and easier to work with.
