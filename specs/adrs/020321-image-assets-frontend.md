## Status: accepted

## Deciders: Teresa

## Context and Problem Statement

What image assest should we use for our final project?

## Things Teresa considered and the decisions for each question
1. What parts of the project should be implemented using image assets and by building?
    - Teresa decided that only 4 asssets of her design are needed: red tomato, green tomato, bolt, and plug. The development team will build everything else for the project.
2. How should the start day graphic be implemented?
    - There were two options for this: timer with a "start" button below it and a green tomato with a "start" overlay. Teresa decided to choose the latter.
3. What should the file types/extensions be for these assets?
    - Both PNG files and SVG files were tested. Currently, the development team is sticking with PNG for the bolt image and SVG for the red tomato, green tomato, and bolt.
