# Feb. 26th 2021, HTML ADR
> (Last Decision: Feb. 26 2021, by Justin Lee)

## Status: accepted

## Deciders: Annika, Andy, and Donald

## Context and Problem Statement

This ADR is meant to keep track of setting up our HTML code in our codebase?

## Things to consider

1. Do we keep all of our HTML code in one file or split it?
2. Does our decision to make separate html files affect local storage?

## Decision outcome
1. Do we keep all of our HTML code in one file or split it? We'll be splitting it.
    - HTML files should now be split into three different files: index.html, done.html, and app.html. These will represent the different page layouts (landing page, timer page, and records sheet page), which makes it more organized and easier to work with. The biggest concern if we were to have everything in on html file would be how and when to hide specific parts.
2. Local storage isn't affected if we use multiple html files.
