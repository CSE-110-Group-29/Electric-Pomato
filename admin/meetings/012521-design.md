## Meeting Notes

- Allen:
  - Presented document/design notes, wants design to be very lightweight, nothing super distracting.
  - Goal should be for user to not put focus on the app itself.
  - When timer starts, the app should "fade away" from the users awareness.
    - Maybe add a shaded layer over the page to dull out the UI and reduce its attention grabbing features.
  - Sort list of tasks by groups.
    - Daily Tasks
    - Urgent Tasks
      - Possibly a button to add urgent task button.
        - Add a break when this button is clicked?
- Teresa:
  - Dominance: The timer should the focus of the page. Secondly the Todo list.
  - Needs a page the user sees the first time they open the webpage.
    - Includes: Title, Motto, Input form to start, and small legend for symbols.
      - Form to start:
        - Takes in your name, then opens the actual pomodoro timer/task list.
  - Adding tasks:
    - Tasks that have a large expected number of pomodoros should flag the user to split task (decompose) into chunks.
  - Task list is hidden/pulls-up from the bottom of the screen.
- Liam:
  - Brought up concerns and suggestions about timing, and recommended amount of pomodoros.
  - Suggests addign recommendation/tooltips to remind user they are going over/under their estimate.
  - Add a legend of symbols used.
  - Add a list of features to present on Friday for the Dev Team to consider.
- Enrique:
  - Add a warning to user that their task list is final once they've finished adding tasks.
