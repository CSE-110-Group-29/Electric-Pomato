- Group
![Grouping of Items](../meeting_images/Groups.png)
  - Everyone said we feel bad that we are contributing enough.
    - But we all said we have an awesome productive group.
    - Discussed if this is a good feeling (in a sense)
  - Mad about time constaints due to othe classes.
- Vote
- Discuss
  - Technical:

    - Messy Branches:
      - Everyone agrees out branches are messy.
      - Currently branches are cleaned, but they weren't during the sprint.
      - One idea: Dev Branch, Testing, Production
        - Might be too late for that
      - Try to have branches be smaller and more specific.
    - JavaScript is gross:
      - It is.
      - Not much we do about it, except emphasize JSDocs and AirBnB's style.
  - Contributions:

    - "Wish I had the skills to participate more":
      - Not all of us have to be coding.
      - There is plenty of work with SE outside of coding.
      - Maybe have more dev meetings on Zoom.
  - Architecture:
    ![Architrcture Items](../meeting_images/ArchitectureTopic.png)
    - We need a Dev meeting before next sprint.
    - Most of this was already covered.
  - Great Teamwork:
    ![Teamwork Items](../meeting_images/TeamworkTopic.png)
    - It's a paradox that we also complain about not commiting enough.
    - I think we don't realize how well out team and work has been.
